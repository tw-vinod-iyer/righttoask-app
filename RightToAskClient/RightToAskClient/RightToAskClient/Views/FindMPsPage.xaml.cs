/*
 * This page allows a person to find which electorates they live in,
 * and hence which MPs represent them.
 *
 * This is used in two possible places:
 * (1) if the person clicks on 'My MP' when setting question metadata,
 * we need to know who their MPs are. After this page,
 * there will be a list of MPs loaded for them to choose from.
 * This is indicated by setting LaunchMPsSelectionPageNext to true.
 * 
 * (2) if the person tries to vote or post a question.
 * In this case, they have generated a name via RegisterPage1
 * and can skip this step (so showSkip should be set to true).
 * And we don't follow with a list of MPs for them to chose from.
